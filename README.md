## Image Carousel:

An image carousel made with NextJs using Typescript And Tailwind,

it fetches images and caption from two different apis and displays them with the option to navigate between
posts with two invisible button on each side and the ability to swipe on mobile, it also auto swipes every 4seconds
and the timer rests every time there is manual intervention

## Possible Future Improvements:

Performance Optimization: Implement lazy loading for images to improve performance, especially for large datasets.

Accessibility Enhancements: Add ARIA roles and attributes for better accessibility and screen reader support.
